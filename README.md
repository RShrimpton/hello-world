Hello!

My name is Ryan and I've been living in Virginia with my wife Miranda for almost a year.  
I love food.  
Yes, food.  
I also really enjoy cooking, hiking, and carpentry.
I have a little rescue dog named Milo (Corgi/Jack Russel mix).  
He would not be an ideal candidate for the open dog position.
